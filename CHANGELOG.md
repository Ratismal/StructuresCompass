# 1.18.1-1.3.0-beta.1 (2021/12/14)


## Features

* implement basic functionalities in 1.18.1 ([a1905ff9](https://github.com/Samarium150/StructuresCompass/commits/a1905ff9))

WARNING: This release is a beta release. 
Structure's available dimensions are not available, because Mojang or Forge deleted the critical function,
and we don't find a new way to make a polyfill. We may remove this feature in the future.
